# nwc-pattern-mining
Non-compliant Window Co-occurrence pattern mining in temporal data

- It is python library to find sequential association patterns in time-series data
- The patterns are found in co-occurence with a specific non-compliant feature (to decipher the reason behinds it's irregular behavior)
- The package uses various pruning methodologies to speed up pattern mining, and hashing for quick support count.
