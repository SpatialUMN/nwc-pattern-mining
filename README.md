# nwc-pattern-mining
Non-compliant Window Co-occurrence pattern mining in temporal data

- A Python library to find sequential association patterns in time-series data, co-occurring with target anomalous windows.
- Anomalous windows are sequences in which a target variable defies expected behavior (e.g. Emissions from a vehicle).
- The patterns are found in co-occurrence with a specific non-compliant feature (to decipher the reason behinds it's irregular behavior).
- The package uses various pruning methodologies to speed up pattern mining, and hashing for quick support count.
- The algorithm is based on research: (Discovering non-compliant window co-occurrence patterns)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10707-016-0289-3]
